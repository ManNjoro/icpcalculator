Hello ManNjoro, below I have provided a feedback for your code kindly check it out:

**Feedback:**
1. **Explain how the canister could be improved:**
   - The code structure is clear and well-organized. However, consider adding comments or documentation to describe the purpose and functionality of critical sections, especially for complex logic or external dependencies.

   - It might be beneficial to provide additional error information in the `Error::DivisionByZero` variant, explaining that the error occurred due to attempting to divide by zero.

   - Since the `CalculatorOperation` enum is also used in the `CalculatorPayload` struct, consider deriving the `Default` trait for `CalculatorOperation` to simplify the default value in `CalculatorPayload`.

   - The `modulus` function returns a `f64` while other operations return a `Result<f64, Error>`. To maintain consistency, consider returning a `Result<f64, Error>` in the `modulus` function, with an appropriate error variant for potential errors.

2. **State technical problems of code or explanations, explain how they could be fixed:**
   - The `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `modulus` functions directly return a `f64`. Consider using the `Result` type consistently across all operations to handle potential errors consistently. For example, you could change their return types to `Result<f64, Error>` and return `Ok(result)`.

   - The `calculate` function could benefit from more explicit error handling. Currently, the `divide` function returns a `Result<f64, Error>`, but the other operations return a `f64` directly. Consider using the `?` operator or the `Result::map` function to propagate errors more explicitly.

**Overall:**
The code demonstrates a functional and well-organized calculator canister. The feedback suggests minor improvements in terms of consistency in error handling and additional documentation. Consider addressing the mentioned points to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
